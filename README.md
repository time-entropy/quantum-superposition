# The essence of quantum-superposition in this Quantized-Elastic Spacetime model

In this framework, quantum superposition arises from the dynamic resonating, multi-layer, multi-axis rotation of a particle's internal SEQ structure—a high-dimensional phase space of possible configurations prior to measurement. The eigenstates correspond to metastable solutions of this system, determined by its intrinsic parameters: mass distribution (gravitational potential storage), electromagnetic coupling, chiral symmetry constraints (e.g., Higgs locking), and initial conditions. Measurement collapses the rotating structure into one of these allowed states. 

Within this framework, all statistical quantities at the Planck time scale can be reduced to analytical determinants, and probabilistic functions are fully reducible to exact analytical formulations—reflecting the intrinsic determinism of SEQ dynamics. In other words, this model is fundamentally a quasi deterministic framework operating at the Planck time scale, where all apparent randomness emerges from higher-level interactions of these discrete deterministic units.

As discussed in Section 3.8 and Section 4, although the past and present states are deterministic, the future still retains degrees of freedom under the joint constraints of entropy increase and the least action principle. The Markovian property dictates that the future depends solely on the immediately preceding state, implying a non-deterministic evolutionary process. This aligns with the model's framework where multiple valid paths may satisfy the minimum action condition.

Affirming the Planck time as the minimal temporal unit is equivalent to accepting the determined state of this current moment at this scale, whereas insisting on probabilistic behavior beneath the Planck time inherently negates its status as the fundamental limit of temporal divisibility.
